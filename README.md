# GuitarModes
This project is the result of my passions for guitar and software development. To run this project--download a copy of the repository and give a few of the python files a play!

## Overview
This application provides you with the tools to practice scales and study musical theory.

## Plans
### My plans from basic to incredibly ambitious are:
 - [x] Establish a way to generate a fretboard in plaintext that reflects a theoretical fretboard.
 - [x] Integrate hz and octaves, differentiate based on that instead of arbitrary index values.
 - [X] Modify getFretBoard.py such that it displays octaves of the notes (targeting version 0.23)
 - [X] Modify getFretBoard such that it is object oriented.
 - [ ] Modify getFredboard.py such that the notes are all padded w/ spacing.
 - [ ] Establish clear definitions and use cases separating 'Aristotelian' Notes from 'Octave Defined' notes. (My language limiting my world, again.)
 - [ ] Dynamically emphasize different notes corresponding to different music theory concepts.
 - [ ] Implement ASIO integration--monitor input--come up with a very basic Rocksmith type thing for practicing.
 - [ ] Make a mobile version.
